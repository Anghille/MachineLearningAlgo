# Introduction

This repository is used to show-case the implementation of most known machine-learning algorithms. From linear regression to SVM, the goal is to develop each model by hand without the extansive using mostly numpy. 
<br><br>

# ToDo
* Complete/Add Tests for utilities function / LinearClass / Metrics
* Add functions to check datatype compatibility inside classes and functions
* Add error/raise to functions (help the devs understand where the error comes from!)
* Continue to add algorithms such as ridge, lasso, classification functions, and such


# Versioning

v1.0.0
* Added *LinearRegression Class* with several computation methods (backpropagation or OLS)
* Added *Regression Metrics* (r2, MSE, MAE, MedAE)
* Added *utility function* train_test_split()
